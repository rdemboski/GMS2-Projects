# Project 2

## Aldo

* Ryan Demboski (5782550)
* Hannah Trenary (5769157)
* Scott Austin (5769599)

## Instructions

Use WASD to move the character around the map. Press the R key to shoot arrows
and aim with your mouse to attack. Gain health potions from defeated enemies to heal 
while you make your way to the final boss. Defeat the boss to win the game!

## Known Bugs or Issues

- Collision detection is buggy while in the main path.
- Arrows have no "expiration", for lack of better words (they are permanent instances, killing bandits off screen)

## Credits
* Ryan Demboski: Created the tweens and sequences, coded the collisions (I am the reason it is buggy), put together the rooms (title, instructions, win/loss screens).  
* Hannah Trenary: Created the room, player, arrow, and health potion sprites and animations, all music and sound effects, helped created the health bar display, and final debugging
* Scott Austin: Created bandit, rat, cabin, tree, knight, and tilemap sprites. Wrote main room creation code, object event code.
