## Instructions

This game is our take on combining elements of beat saber and guitar hero. The goal is to get the highest score  you can with 3 lives. Blocks with a letter, either W/A/S/D, will come towards you and you must hit the appropriate key while the block is within the green region. You will lose a life if the block passes the green region and you did not press in time.

## Known Bugs or Issues
