## Credits

* Ryan Demboski: Designed the rooms, created the animations (tweenGMS and sequences), put together hangman and made the conditions for parts being visible/invisble

* Hannah Trenary: Made the sprites and objects for the letters and hangman parts, created the word library, implemented a randomization system for the selection of the word per game, and created/led the plan of implementation.

* Scott Austin: Worked on the code that handles the room creation and also the code that handles keyboard input and changes the dash instances to correct letters. Also worked on handling when a win/lose condition is met and therefore updates the room.
